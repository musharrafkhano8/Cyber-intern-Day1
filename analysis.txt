 Port & Service Analysis

1. 135/tcp (msrpc)**  
   - Used for Microsoft RPC (Remote Procedure Call)  
   - Often targeted in Windows RPC-related vulnerabilities  
   - Risk: Can be exploited in remote code execution attacks if not patched

2. 139/tcp (netbios-ssn)**  
   - NetBIOS Session Service  
   - Used in Windows file/printer sharing  
   - Risk: Information leakage, vulnerable to NetBIOS enumeration

3. 445/tcp (microsoft-ds)**  
   - SMB over TCP  
   - Common attack vector for WannaCry & EternalBlue exploits  
   - Risk: High, if SMBv1 is enabled and unpatched

4. 5357/tcp (wsdapi)**  
   - Web Services for Devices (used for device discovery)  
   - Risk: Usually low, but may expose networked devices

5. 7070/tcp (realserver)**  
   - Used by RealNetworks RealServer (streaming)  
   - Risk: Uncommon service; ensure it's intended and up-to-date

 Summary of Risks
- High-risk ports: 445, 135
- Medium: 139
- Recommendation: Disable unnecessary services, patch OS, and use firewall rules to block external access.
